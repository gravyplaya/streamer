Mediafire Mp3 streamer by Geovanni

This very simply allows you to stream the mp3 files from your Mediafire.com account. Very useful for people who store alot of music in their mediafire account and want to hear it without downloading. Like me, which was my reason for writing this.

Requirements:
	jQuery, Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore.js, PHP

NOTE: Currently there is no way to login to Mediafire and you must enter your login creds in the config.php file (soon to be fixed :)
