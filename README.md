Mediafire Mp3 streamer by Geovanni

This very simply allows you to stream the mp3 files from your Mediafire.com account. Very useful for people who store alot of music in their mediafire account and want to hear it without downloading. Like me, which was my reason for writing this.

Requirements:
	jQuery, Bootstrap, Backbone, Underscore.js, PHP

NOTE: Currently there is no way to login to Mediafire and you must enter your login creds in the config.php file (soon to be fixed :)

UPDATE: (8/21/2013) After some investigation and thought I have decided to rewrite this using the AngularJS framework. The next update will contain completely new code. 

UPDATE: (02/22/2014) Development has stopped as the native Mediafire app allows mp3 streaming. Plus there is a bug in the Mediafire API that will not allow you to get more than 20 files in a dir which created a near impossible situation when paginating file listings. :(
